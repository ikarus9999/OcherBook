Currently, OcherBook is only tested to build with Cygwin.  MinGW is planned,
since that will give a better end-user experience (native WIN32).  Until that
time, only the "fd" and "ncurses" output drivers are supported.

Install Cygwin, including:
    gcc
    make
    optional:
        wget
        ncurses
        ncurses-devel

Edit ocher.config:
```
OCHER_TARGET=cygwin
```

make
