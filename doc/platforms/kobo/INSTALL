# Overview #

Currently, OcherBook is not a full replacement for the Kobo's firmware.  It
is only intended to replace "nickel".  The Kobo's kernel, boot scripts, and
wireless networking are left as-is.

You'll want to enable FTP and telnet access to your Kobo, upload "ocher" and
a font and an epub, telnet in, and run it.  Run with "-vv" to get some logging
output to stderr.

Notes on rooting your Kobo:

# Status #

This is a work-in-progress.  For example:

- margins and word-wrap not done
- touch screen is not wired up; must control via telnet (press Enter for next
  page, etc)
- must upload a font manually; path must match what's compiled in
- no file browser; must specify on command line
- very slow to open large books because currently laying it all out when the
  book is opened.
