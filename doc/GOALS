OcherBook is an open-source ebook reader, supporting multiple file formats and
output devices.  It focuses on creating a good (and portable) ebook reading
experience, but not necessarily the complete software stack.  For example, for
expediency it may reuse the existing kernel on ereaders.


Technology is hard to push back against.  Books are/will be moving to
electronic.  But what problems does that pose?
    - Privacy
    - Control
    - Accessibility
    - Reliability


How does OcherBook handle these issues?

Privacy:
    - All local, no cloud
    - Open source
    - No tracking / cloud / FB integration / etc
    - Encryption
        - Of personal reading record / notes
        - ...

Control:
    - All local, no cloud
    - No DRM
        - You can read whatever, whenever
        - Your books cannot be removed by 3rd party
    - Ability to import / export your reading record / notes / etc

Accessibility: How do we enjoy e-books without creating a new dark age?
(Consider DRM, technological obsolescence, peak oil, ...)
    - All local, no cloud
    - Multiple architectures
    - Multiple output devices
    - Support new and old tech
    - Low resource requirements / low power
    - Archiving is still the user's problem...
        - Or is there a server side?
    - Background:
        http://traffic.libsyn.com/kunstlercast/KunstlerCast_201.mp3

Reliability:
    - Books do not crash or hang
        - Mass stress-test against real world library
