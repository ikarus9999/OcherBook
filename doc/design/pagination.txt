How to paginate?
================

Users probably still expect page numbers.  But accurately calculating them is
very slow (at least for framebuffers).

Three options:

* Accurately calculate the page numbers, for the user's font settings.  Very
slow (minutes).  Even with caching of the layout, this is probably not
realistic.
* Statistical "pages".  Faster, but possibly confusing.  No one-to-one mapping
between physical and logical pages, and book may end early or late.
* Discard page numbers, and favor better navigation.  Difficult to retrain
users, but faster and possibly more useful.


Survey
------

Kobo seems to estimate the number of pages based on some statistical guess at
how many characters fit on a page (probably assuming some common font size,
etc).  For example, take two Kobos, set one to a large font size and the other
to a small font size, and load the same (new!) book onto them.  They'll each
say it has the same number of pages, regardless of your font size.  The actual
end of the book has no relation to the claimed page numbers.
