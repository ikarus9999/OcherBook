Drop-in crash handlers for POSIX, particularly embedded Linux.

Dumps registers, backtrace, and instruction stream to a file descriptor.
Intended to be self-contained and resilient.  Where possible, will detect and
intelligently handle corrupt state, such as jumping through a bad pointer or a
blown stack.  The harvesting and reporting of the crash log is left as an
exercise for the reader.

Quick start:

1. Include airbag_fd.c and airbag_fd.h in your project.
2. If it doesn't build, define the appropriate DISABLE_* flag(s).
3. Call one of the airbag_init_* functions early.
4. Post-crash (perhaps in a watchdog or on next startup) harvest crash logs.

Example test:

$ g++ -Os -Wall -Wextra -ldl airbag_fd.c airbag_fd_test.c -o airbag_fd_test
$ ./airbag_fd_test.sh


Notes:

x86:

x86_64:
No heuristics for trashed stack.

mips:

arm:
Optionally build your application with -mpoke-function-name.
