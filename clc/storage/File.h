/**
 *  Portable blocking file IO.  Similar to the POSIX model but with some conveniences
 *  and some portability.
 *
 *  When you construct (or otherwise initialize) a clc::File, the file is automatically opened.
 *  The file is closed when you re-initialize or destroy the object.
 *
 *  At each initialization, you're asked to supply an "open mode" value. This is a combination of
 *  flags that tells the object whether you want to read and/or write the file, create it if it
 *  doesn't exist, truncate it, and so on.
 *
 *  Since there are portability issues with using off_t or assuming 2G or 4G max files, this code
 *  explicitly uses uint64_t for all sizes and offsets.
 *
 *  Files are always treated as binary.  No implicit conversion is performed.
 *
 *  @todo  Deal with UTF8 on Windows
 *  @todo  Rationalize exceptions vs return codes
