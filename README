OcherBook is an open-source ebook reader, supporting multiple file formats and
output devices.  It focuses on creating a good (and portable) ebook reading
experience, but not necessarily the complete software stack.  For example, for
expediency it may reuse the existing kernel on ereaders.

To get started, look in the doc directory, and/or "make help".

To see what platforms are supported and to what degree, look in doc/platforms/.
